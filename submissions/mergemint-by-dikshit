## Project Title
mergemint

## Project Description
mergemint is a platform that turns open-source contribution into a game: repository owners connect GitHub via a webhook, and every PR that gets merged earns the contributor “MM points.” These points appear in a personal dashboard and can be redeemed for Solana SPL tokens listed in the built-in store. Our goal is to ensure that even the smallest contributor is rewarded and feels motivated to keep contributing, while maintainers attract fresh talent.

## Inspiration behind the Project
During Hacktoberfest I spoke with friends who wanted to join open source but felt blocked: most bounty-backed issues are too advanced for beginners, so enthusiasm fades quickly. mergemint flips that dynamic—encouraging newcomers to launch their own open-source ideas on the Solana blockchain instead of hunting for “easy” issues—so they stay motivated while still giving back to the community.

*( i forgot to mention that mergemint is currently a prototype with a clear plan to scale; i'm hoping that redemption pools will be funded through partnerships with open-source-friendly companies or through Solana ecosystem grants.)*
